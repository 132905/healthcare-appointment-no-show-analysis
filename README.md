-   Analyzing the structure of the data.

###   2.  No-show Rate Analysis

-   Overall no-show rate.
-   No-show rates by gender.
-   Average age of patients who showed vs. no-show.
-   Neighbourhood with the highest no-show rate.

###   3.  Appointment Scheduling Analysis

-   Time between scheduling and appointment.
-   No-show rate for appointments scheduled on the same day.
-   Effectiveness of SMS reminders.

###   4.  Patient Demographics and Health Factors

-   Impact of age, gender, and scholarship on no-show.
-   Influence of medical conditions (Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap) on no-show.

## 📊 Sample Analysis Questions Answered

-   What is the overall no-show rate?
-   How does gender affect no-show rates?
-   What is the age distribution of patients who miss appointments?
-   Which neighborhoods have the highest no-show rates?
-   Does receiving an SMS reminder reduce the likelihood of a no-show?
-   How does the time between scheduling and appointment day influence no-shows?
-   Do patients with specific health conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) have higher no-show rates?

(Refer to `Healthcare project case study.docx` and `Medical Data Analysis Case Study.ipynb` for the full list of analysis questions.)

## 🚀 Future Scope

-   Develop predictive models to forecast no-shows.
-   Incorporate additional data (e.g., patient feedback, appointment type) for more comprehensive analysis.
-   Create an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring of appointment attendance.
